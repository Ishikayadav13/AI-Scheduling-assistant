# AI-Scheduling-assistant

An interactive Streamlit web app for energy demand forecasting, clustering of consumption patterns, and generating state-level insights. The assistant supports time series forecasting using either Facebook Prophet or SARIMAX, KMeans clustering with PCA visualization, and insightful metrics like predictability, seasonal variability, and peak-to-average ratios.

ðŸš€ Features

ðŸ“ˆ Forecasting

1.Forecast monthly energy demand for selected states. 2.Choose between Prophet (if available) and SARIMAX. 3.Configurable forecast horizon (3â€“18 months). 4.Interactive Plotly charts with confidence intervals. 5.Export forecast results as CSV.

ðŸ§­ Clustering 1.Cluster states by their consumption patterns using KMeans. 2.Visualize clusters using: 3.Heatmaps (consumption across months). 4.PCA scatter plots (2D projection of states). 5.Save cluster assignments to Excel for further analysis.
